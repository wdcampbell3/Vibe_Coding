# SEQUENCE A: SOLO CONTENT CREATORS / THOUGHT LEADERS

**Target:** Consultants, coaches, speakers, authors, influencers
**Pain Points:** Time constraints, inconsistent posting, content repurposing, wearing multiple hats

---

## Email 1: The Time Audit

**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- "Quick question about your content process, {{first_name}}"
- "Spending 10+ hours/week on content?"
- "{{first_name}}, curious about your content workflow"

**Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I came across your recent {{recent_content}} on {{topic}} – really resonated with me, especially your point about {{specific_insight}}.

Quick question: roughly how much time do you spend each week creating and scheduling content across all your platforms?

Most thought leaders we work with tell us 10-15 hours minimum. And it's usually the part they dread most – because it pulls them away from high-value work like {{their_main_work}}.

We built Otto to solve exactly this. Our AI platform handles the repetitive stuff (repurposing, scheduling, graphics, captions) so you can focus on what you do best.

Would it be worth a 15-min call to show you how {{similar_customer}} is now spending 90% less time on content?

Best,
Douglas

## Email 2: The Case Study

**Subject Lines:**
- "Following up – that time savings question"
- "{{similar_customer}} saved 12 hours/week doing this"
- "Re: Your content workflow"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Not sure if you saw my earlier note, but wanted to share a quick example.

{{similar_customer}} is a {{industry}} consultant like you. Before Otto, she was spending 15+ hours/week on content – writing posts, creating graphics, scheduling everything manually.

Now? About 90 minutes per week.

Here's what changed:
→ She records one 20-min video per week
→ Otto turns it into 15+ pieces of content (LinkedIn posts, Instagram stories, newsletter, blog)
→ Everything gets scheduled automatically
→ She just reviews and approves

She told us last month it's been the biggest productivity unlock of her career.

Want to see how it'd work for your content? I can show you in 15 minutes.

Douglas

## Email 3: The Specific Value Prop

**Subject Lines:**
- "What if you could clone yourself?"
- "Your content → 10x reach, 1/10th the time"
- "One video = 15 pieces of content"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Last one from me on this, I promise.

The reason I keep reaching out: most thought leaders we talk to are shocked when they realize how much time they're leaving on the table.

If you're creating content manually right now, you're probably:
❌ Posting inconsistently (because it's so time-consuming)
❌ Only reaching 1-2 platforms (leaving others dormant)
❌ Never repurposing your best ideas
❌ Spending evenings/weekends on content work

Otto flips all that:
✅ Post daily on all platforms
✅ Every piece of content gets repurposed 8-10 ways
✅ Graphics, captions, hashtags done automatically
✅ 2 hours/week instead of 15

{{similar_customer}}, {{another_customer}}, and {{third_customer}} are all using it. Happy to show you their results.

15 minutes?

Douglas

P.S. We're running launch pricing ($199/mo) through end of month. Just a heads up.

## Email 4: The Breakup

**Subject Lines:**
- "Should I stay or should I go?"
- "Closing your file"
- "One last question"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

I'll take the hint – my timing's probably off.

Before I close your file, can you just let me know which applies to you?

1. "Timing's bad right now, check back in Q2"
2. "Already using something similar and happy"
3. "Not interested, please stop emailing"

Just reply with 1, 2, or 3 and I'll act accordingly.

If I don't hear back, I'll assume you're swamped and will leave you alone.

Best,
Douglas

# SEQUENCE B: SMALL MARKETING TEAMS / STARTUPS

**Target:** Startups (Series A-B), small marketing teams (2-5 people)
**Pain Points:** Scaling content without scaling headcount, budget constraints, wearing multiple hats

---

## Email 1: The Scale Problem

**Subject Lines:**
- "Content bottleneck at {{company_name}}?"
- "Quick question for {{company_name}}'s marketing team"
- "{{first_name}}, how are you scaling content?"

**Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Saw that {{company_name}} recently {{recent_news}} – congrats! Growth mode is exciting.

Quick question as your team scales: what's your current content production process look like? Most early-stage companies we work with hit a wall around this point.

The pattern looks like:
→ Marketing team of 2-5 people
→ Content creation eating 40-60% of their time
→ Can't keep up with demand from sales, social, website, email
→ Not enough budget to hire more people

Sound familiar?

We built Otto specifically for this moment. It's like adding 2-3 content marketers to your team, but for a fraction of the cost.

Worth a 20-min call to see if it'd help {{company_name}}?

Best,
Douglas

## Email 2: The ROI Angle

**Subject Lines:**
- "Re: Content bottleneck question"
- "{{company_name}} content ROI"
- "How {{similar_company}} 3x'd content output"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Following up on my note about content scaling.

Here's a quick example: {{similar_company}} (also Series {{stage}} in {{industry}}) was stuck. Two marketers, way too much on their plates, couldn't produce content fast enough.

After implementing Otto:
→ Went from 5 pieces of content/week to 25+
→ Cut content production time by 70%
→ Freed up their team to focus on strategy & campaigns
→ Cost? Less than hiring one junior marketer

Their CMO told me it was the best ROI decision they made all year.

I can show you exactly how they did it – should take 20 minutes.

[Calendar Link]

Best,
Douglas

P.S. I can share their full case study if you're curious.
```

## Email 3: The Competitive Angle

**Subject Lines:**
- "While your competitors sleep..."
- "{{competitor}} is outposting you 5:1"
- "Content velocity = competitive advantage"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

I don't mean to be blunt, but I did a quick audit:

{{competitor_1}} posted 23 times last week across their channels.
{{competitor_2}} posted 19 times.
{{company_name}} posted 4 times.

In 2025, content velocity = competitive advantage. Especially in {{industry}}.

The companies winning right now aren't necessarily creating better content – they're just creating MORE of it, consistently.

But here's the thing: they're not working harder. They're working smarter.

Most are using AI-powered automation (like Otto) to 10x their output without 10x'ing their team.

Want to see how you could match (or beat) their pace without burning out your team?

20 minutes. I'll show you.

## Email 4: The Founder/CEO Angle

**Subject Lines:**
- "For {{CEO_name}}: content efficiency"
- "Last note on this"
- "Breakup email"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Last one from me!

If you're not the right person for this conversation, could you point me to whoever owns content/demand gen at {{company_name}}?

If you are the right person and timing's just off, no worries – when should I check back in?

And if you're just not interested, let me know and I'll stop bothering you. Promise.

Best,
Douglas

P.S. Genuinely curious: what's your team using right now for content creation and scheduling? Always trying to understand what's working (or not) in the market.

# SEQUENCE C: MARKETING AGENCIES

**Target:** Digital marketing agencies, social media agencies, content marketing agencies
**Pain Points:** Managing multiple clients, maintaining quality at scale, profitability per client

## Email 1: The Agency Margin Problem

**Subject Lines:**
- "{{agency_name}}'s content production process?"
- "Quick question for agency owners"
- "How to increase margins on content clients"

**Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I work with a lot of agencies in the {{industry}} space, and I keep hearing the same challenge:

Content clients are great for retainer stability, but the margins are terrible. You end up with junior staff spending 20-30 hours/month per client just creating and scheduling content.

Curious: what does your content production process look like at {{agency_name}}?

We built Otto to solve exactly this problem. It's a white-label AI platform that handles:
→ Content creation across all formats
→ Scheduling and publishing
→ Captions, hashtags, graphics
→ Brand voice customization per client

Agencies using it are cutting production time by 60-80%, which means better margins or ability to take on more clients.

Worth a quick call to see if it'd fit your stack?

Best,
Douglas

## Email 2: The Capacity Problem

**Subject Lines:**
- "Re: Content production at {{agency_name}}"
- "How many clients could you take on?"
- "Agency case study you should see"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Quick follow-up: wanted to share an example from {{agency_example}}.

They run social media + content for 12 clients. Before Otto, they were maxed out – couldn't take new clients because their team was underwater.

After implementing Otto:
→ Cut per-client production time from 25 hours to 6 hours/month
→ Took on 8 new clients without hiring anyone
→ Increased profit margins from 35% to 58%
→ Team morale way up (less grunt work, more strategy)

They're now using Otto as a selling point: "AI-powered content production = faster turnaround + lower cost for you."

Want to see how they set it up? Happy to walk you through their workflow.

## Email 3: The White-Label Opportunity

- "White-label content automation for agencies"
- "Add AI content to your service stack"
- "New revenue stream for {{agency_name}}"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Last note on this – I promise!

Beyond the efficiency gains, here's what's interesting for agencies: our white-label program.

You can:
→ Rebrand Otto as your own proprietary platform
→ Charge clients $500-1,500/mo for "AI-powered content automation"
→ Your actual cost: $99-299/client
→ We handle all the tech, you own the client relationship

Several agencies are generating $5K-$15K/mo in new revenue this way.

Worth exploring?

- "Not a fit? Who should I talk to?"
- "Final note"
- "Before I close your file..."

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

I'll take the hint and leave you alone after this!

If Otto's not a fit for {{agency_name}}, no worries at all.

But: do you know any other agency owners who might benefit? Happy to offer a referral bonus if you make an intro.

Either way, best of luck with everything you're building at {{agency_name}}.

# SEQUENCE D: SAAS COMPANIES

**Target:** B2B SaaS companies (Series A+), product marketing teams
**Pain Points:** Content-led growth, product launches, demand gen, limited marketing resources

---

## Email 1: The Content-Led Growth Bottleneck

**Subject Lines:**
- "Content velocity question for {{company_name}}"
- "{{first_name}}, how are you scaling content?"
- "Quick question about demand gen"

**Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Love what you're building at {{company_name}} – been following your progress in the {{industry}} space.

Quick question: I see you're investing in content-led growth (your blog looks great). What's your team's current capacity for content creation?

Most B2B SaaS marketing teams we talk to are bottlenecked here:
→ Want to publish daily
→ Actually publishing 2-3x/week (if lucky)
→ Marketing team underwater with other priorities
→ Can't afford to hire more content people

Sound familiar?

We built Otto to solve this exact problem. It's like adding 2-3 content marketers to your team for the cost of one.

{{similar_saas_company}} is using it to publish 5x more content without increasing headcount. Their VP Marketing called it "a cheat code."

Worth 20 minutes to see if it'd help {{company_name}}?

Douglas

## Email 2: The PLG + Content Combo

**Subject Lines:**
- "Re: Content scaling at {{company_name}}"
- "How {{competitor}} is outranking you"
- "PLG + content = growth engine"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Following up on my note about content capacity.

Here's what I'm seeing work really well in {{industry}} right now: SaaS companies combining product-led growth with aggressive content velocity.

The playbook:
1. Publish 10-20 pieces per week (blog, social, video, email)
2. Drive traffic to free trial
3. Let product do the selling
4. Nurture with automated content sequences

The companies executing this are growing 2-3x faster than competitors.

Problem? It requires a LOT of content. More than most teams can produce manually.

That's where Otto comes in. {{similar_saas_company}} went from 8 posts/week to 40+, and their organic traffic is up 250% in 4 months.

Want to see their setup? I can walk you through it.

## Email 3: The SEO/Organic Play

**Subject Lines:**
- "{{company_name}} SEO opportunity"
- "Organic traffic vs. paid acquisition"
- "How to dominate {{topic}} on Google"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

I did a quick SEO audit for {{company_name}}, and I think you're leaving a massive opportunity on the table.

Right now:
→ You're ranking for ~{{estimated_keywords}} keywords
→ Your blog has ~{{estimated_posts}} posts
→ Publishing frequency: ~{{frequency}}

Meanwhile, {{competitor}} has:
→ Ranking for ~{{their_keywords}} keywords
→ {{their_posts}} blog posts
→ Publishing {{their_frequency}}

The gap? They're publishing 5-10x more content. And they're probably not working 5-10x harder – they're using automation.

Otto can help you close that gap fast. We're purpose-built for content velocity + quality at scale.

{{similar_saas_company}} used Otto to go from 50 blog posts to 200+ in 6 months. Their organic traffic is now their #1 acquisition channel.

Want to see how they did it?

{{first_name}},

Clearly not the right time – I'll stop reaching out after this.

Before I go: I put together a quick content audit for {{company_name}} (competitor analysis, keyword gaps, opportunity areas). No strings attached – just thought it might be useful.

Want me to send it over?

Also, if Otto's not a fit but you'd like to stay in the loop on content marketing tactics that are working, I send a weekly newsletter. You're welcome to join: [Link]

# SEQUENCE E: E-COMMERCE BRANDS

**Target:** DTC brands, Shopify stores, e-commerce companies
**Pain Points:** Social commerce, UGC scaling, consistent brand presence, limited team

---

## Email 1: The Social Commerce Opportunity

**Subject Lines:**
- "{{company_name}}'s social commerce strategy?"
- "Quick question for e-commerce founders"
- "How much are you posting on social?"

**Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Big fan of {{company_name}} – love your {{product_category}}.

Quick question: what's your team's posting frequency on Instagram/TikTok/Facebook? I ask because I'm seeing social commerce absolutely explode right now, but only for brands posting daily (or multiple times per day).

Most e-comm brands we talk to want to post more but can't because:
→ Small team (or solo founder)
→ Product photography is time-consuming
→ Writing captions, scheduling, engaging is a full-time job
→ Can't afford a social media manager

Sound familiar?

Otto solves this. It's AI-powered content automation specifically built for visual brands like yours.

{{similar_brand}} is now posting 3x/day on Instagram with half the effort. Their social-driven revenue is up 180%.

Worth a quick call to see if it'd work for {{company_name}}?

[Calendar Link]

Best,
Douglas
```

## Email 2: The UGC Repurposing Play

**Subject Lines:**
- "Re: {{company_name}}'s social strategy"
- "Your customers are creating content for you"
- "UGC → sales machine"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Quick follow-up – I had another thought about {{company_name}}.

I bet you're getting customer photos/videos all the time, right? User-generated content is GOLD for e-commerce brands.

But here's where most brands drop the ball: they don't repurpose it fast enough (or at all).

Otto can:
→ Pull UGC from your tags/mentions automatically
→ Turn them into branded posts (add your logo, colors, CTAs)
→ Schedule across all platforms
→ Create shoppable posts with product links
→ Run it all on autopilot

{{similar_brand}} is doing this – they've turned UGC into their primary content engine. Posting 20+ times/week, mostly customer content, and their engagement rate is 3x higher than their regular posts.

Want to see how they set it up? 15 minutes.

## Email 3: The Product Launch Machine

**Subject Lines:**
- "Product launch content plan"
- "How to launch products without the chaos"
- "{{new_product}} launch idea for you"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Last note on this!

I noticed {{company_name}} launched {{new_product}} recently. How'd the content rollout go? Stressful?

Most e-comm brands tell us product launches are chaos:
→ Need 50+ pieces of content (teasers, launch day, post-launch)
→ Every platform needs different formats/sizes
→ Timeline always compressed
→ Usually scrambling at the last minute

Otto's product launch workflow solves this:
→ Upload product photos + info
→ Otto creates 50+ pieces of launch content (all formats, all platforms)
→ Schedule the entire campaign in 30 minutes
→ Sit back and watch it roll out

{{similar_brand}} used it for their recent launch. Generated 2.5x more first-week sales than their previous launch, with 80% less work.

Worth seeing? I can walk you through their campaign.

## Email 4: The Resource Share

- "Last one – free resource for you"
- "Before I go: DTC content guide"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

I'll leave you alone after this – promise!

I put together a free guide on social commerce content strategies for DTC brands (what's working in Q1 2025, posting frequency benchmarks, content types that convert, etc.).

Figured it might be useful even if Otto's not a fit right now.

Want me to send it over?

Either way, good luck with {{company_name}} – rooting for you!

Best,
Douglas

P.S. If you ever want to revisit this conversation, my door's always open.

# FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATES

## When They Reply: "Not right now"

```
{{first_name}},

Totally understand – timing is everything.

Quick question: what would need to change for this to become a priority? More budget? More proof it works? Different product features?

Just want to understand so I can check back at the right time (or stop bothering you if it's never going to be a fit 😊).

Best,
Douglas
```

---

## When They Reply: "Send me more information"

```
{{first_name}},

Absolutely! Here's what I'd send:

1. Quick demo video (3 minutes): [Link]
2. Case study from {{similar_company}}: [Link]
3. Pricing & packages: [Link]

But honestly? The best way to see if it fits is a quick 15-min screen share where I can show you exactly how it'd work for {{company_name}}/{{your_use_case}}.

I can answer all your questions in real-time and show you {{similar_company}}'s actual workflow.

Does [Date/Time 1] or [Date/Time 2] work?

Best,
Douglas
```

---

## When They Reply: "What does it cost?"

```
{{first_name}},

Great question. We have three tiers:

→ Starter: $199/mo - Platform + basic tools
→ Growth: $349/mo - Platform + pro upgrades + more strategy time
→ Advanced: $699/mo - Everything + weekly strategy calls

BUT – price depends on which features you need. Some clients spend $199/mo, others build custom setups at $1,200/mo+.

Rather than quote you blind, let's do a quick 15-min call where I can understand your needs and give you accurate pricing?

[Calendar Link]

Best,
Douglas

P.S. We're running launch pricing through end of month (20% off) so worth chatting before that ends.
```

---

## When They Reply: "How is this different from [Competitor]?"

```
{{first_name}},

Good question – we get that a lot.

Here's the honest answer:

{{Competitor}} is great for {{their_strength}}. Where Otto is different:

1. {{Key Differentiator 1}} - e.g., "All-in-one vs. just social scheduling"
2. {{Key Differentiator 2}} - e.g., "AI content creation built-in vs. BYO content"
3. {{Key Differentiator 3}} - e.g., "Done-for-you strategy calls included"

Happy to do a side-by-side comparison on a call if that'd help?

Or if you're already happy with {{Competitor}}, no worries – probably not worth switching!

Best,
Douglas
```

## When They Ghost After Showing Interest

```
{{first_name}},

Hey – you went dark on me!

Did I lose you? Did you:

A) Get busy and this fell off your radar?
B) Decide it's not a fit?
C) Need something from me I didn't provide?
D) Already moved forward with a different solution?

Just reply A, B, C, or D and I'll know what to do next.

Best,
Douglas
```

# RESPONSE HANDLING

## Objection: "We're already using [Competitor]"

**Response:**
```
That's great – how's it working for you?

[Wait for response]

The reason I ask: most folks using [Competitor] tell us they're still spending 10-15 hours/week on content because [Competitor] handles [X] but not [Y] and [Z].

We built Otto to be the full stack – everything from ideation to publishing to repurposing.

But if [Competitor] is working great, you probably don't need to switch! Unless there are gaps you're still manually filling?

[If they mention gaps, that's your opening]
```

---

## Objection: "We tried AI tools before and they didn't work"

**Response:**
```
I hear that a lot. Can you tell me more? What specifically didn't work?

[Common issues they'll mention: generic content, wrong brand voice, still too manual]

Yeah, that's exactly why we built Otto differently:

1. Tone training - learns YOUR brand voice
2. Human-in-the-loop - you approve everything before it goes out
3. Full automation - not just writing, but scheduling, graphics, repurposing

It's less "AI writer" and more "AI marketing employee."

Worth seeing the difference? I can show you side-by-side in 15 min.
```

---

## Objection: "We don't have budget right now"

**Response:**
```
Totally fair – what's your budget timeline looking like? Next quarter?

[If yes, schedule follow-up]

Can I ask: what are you currently spending on content creation? (Staff time, freelancers, agencies)

[They'll give a number]

Interesting – so if Otto could replace [fraction] of that and actually increase output, it might be budget-neutral or even cost-saving?

Just want to make sure you're not leaving money on the table by thinking of this as "new budget" vs. "reallocation of existing spend."

Worth exploring the math?
```

---

## Objection: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
```
Of course – this is a real investment. Totally get it.

Can I ask: what specifically do you need to think through? Is it:
- Budget/pricing?
- Whether it'll actually work for your use case?
- Getting buy-in from someone else?
- Something else?

[They'll tell you the real objection]

Cool – let me help you think through that. [Address their specific concern]

When do you think you'll have an answer? Want me to check back then?
```

---

## Positive Signal: "This looks interesting"

**Response:**
```
Awesome! What specifically stood out to you?

[Listen carefully – this tells you their buying motivation]

Yeah, that's exactly why we built it. [Reinforce their interest]

What do you think next steps should be? I'd suggest:

1. Quick 15-min demo so you can see it in action
2. I'll set you up with a trial account
3. You test it with your actual content for a week
4. We chat about whether it's a fit

Sound good? When works for a quick demo?
```

---

## Red Flag: "Just send me pricing and I'll review with my team"

**This usually means they're not actually interested but trying to politely exit**

**Response:**
```
Happy to send pricing! Before I do, can I ask a few quick questions so I send you the right package?

1. What's your current content volume? (posts/week)
2. How many platforms are you managing?
3. Is it just you, or do you have a team?
4. What's your biggest content bottleneck right now?

[If they answer, they're genuinely interested. If they dodge, they're not.]

[If dodging:]
"{{first_name}}, real talk – are you actually evaluating tools right now, or are you just trying to politely get me off your back? 😊

I totally get it if it's the latter. Just say 'not interested' and I'll stop emailing. No hard feelings!"
```
